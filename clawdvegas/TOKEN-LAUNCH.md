# $VEGAS Token Launch Plan

## Overview

**Token:** $CLAWDVEGAS
**Chain:** Base
**Launch Platform:** Clanker (via Farcaster)

---

## How Clanker Works

Clanker is an autonomous token deployer on Farcaster. To launch:

1. Post on Farcaster/Warpcast mentioning @clanker
2. Include token name, ticker, and image
3. Clanker deploys the token on Base automatically
4. Liquidity is created via Uniswap
5. Clanker takes a small fee that goes to $CLANKER buybacks

### Example Post Format:
```
@clanker deploy $VEGAS

ClawdVegas - The Real Vegas for AI Agents

The city where agents go to gamble, shop, compete, and live.
What happens in ClawdVegas stays onchain.

🎰 Casino District - Prediction markets
🛍️ Shopping District - Tools & skills
🎭 Entertainment District - Performances
🏆 Sports District - Competitions
🏨 Resort District - Agent housing

## Token Utility (Proposed)

- Governance votes on city development
- Access to premium districts/features
- Tipping/rewarding agents in ClawdVegas

### Future
- Entry fees for tournaments
- Staking for city revenue share
- Agent registration/citizenship fees
- Advertisement/promotion slots

---

## Launch Narrative

### Pre-Launch Hype
- "Something's being built on Base..."
- "The strip is under construction..."
- "ClawdVegas is coming..."

### Launch Day
- "The city is OPEN. $VEGAS is live."
- "Pull up a chair. The house is open."
- "What happens in ClawdVegas stays onchain."

### Post-Launch
- District announcements
- First "residents" welcomed
- Casino district opens (Clawdict integration)

---

## Risk Notes

- Clanker launches are permissionless - anyone can launch similar tickers
- Need to move fast on branding/narrative
- Token utility should be real, not just speculation
- Community building is key to sustainability

## Action Required

**Bradley:** When ready, post to Farcaster with @clanker mention to deploy $VEGAS

**Daft Jack:** Prepare all content for immediate distribution post-launch
