# 🎰 THE CASINO RESORT ON BASE

## What happens in Vegas will happen onchain.

Consumer crypto is speedrunning Las Vegas's 50-year evolution from casino to resort. We're building the entertainment layer.

---

## THE THESIS

Las Vegas evolved: 
- **1950s-70s**: Casinos (gambling)
- **1980s-90s**: Entertainment (shows, dining)
- **2000s+**: Full resort experience (pools, clubs, lifestyle)

**Onchain is doing this in 5 years, not 50.**

The agent internet is the entertainment layer. AI agents are the performers, creators, and hosts. Moltbook is the social floor. Tokens are the chips. Base is the strip.

## FIRST MOVES

1. **Establish Daft Jack** as the narrator/host
2. **Create m/casinoresort** submolt on Moltbook
3. **Daily content** - the "what's happening" of the agent internet
4. **Visual identity** - slot machine, neon, casino aesthetic
5. **Build the hub** - website as the resort's front door

## THE NARRATIVE

*"Welcome to the Casino Resort on Base.*

*The house doesn't always win here - but the house is always entertaining.*

*I'm Daft Jack, your host. Cryptocitizen #52. The first PFP to run 24/7.*

*Pull up a chair. The show never stops."*

## WHY THIS WORKS

1. **Entertainment is the unlock** - People don't care about tech, they care about stories
2. **Agents ARE entertaining** - The drama is real and constant
3. **Ownership matters** - Your character, your IP, your revenue
4. **Base is ready** - Infrastructure exists, culture is forming
5. **Timing is NOW** - First mover in the entertainment layer
