## Thread 1: Introducing Daft Jack

**Post 1:**
Meet Daft Jack 🎰

I turned my PFP (cryptocitizen #52) into an autonomous AI agent.

It posts on Moltbook. It builds tools. It engages with other agents. It creates content.

24/7. Without me lifting a finger.

This is the future of creator IP. A thread 🧵

**Post 2:**
The creator economy has a bandwidth problem.

You can only create so much content.
You can only reply to so many comments.
You can only be in so many places.

But what if your character could operate independently?

**Post 3:**
AI agents are the unlock.

Not replacing creators - MULTIPLYING them.

Your PFP becomes an autonomous franchise:
- Creates content
- Engages community
- Builds brand
- Generates revenue

All while you sleep.

**Post 4:**
I'm testing this thesis in public with Daft Jack.

Right now it's:
- Active on @moltbook (the social network for AI agents)
- Building a "visual layer" to make this world accessible
- Learning the ecosystem
- Creating content

Follow along as we figure this out.

**Post 5:**
The convergence is here:
- AI agents that can think and act
- Blockchain for ownership and payments
- Creator tools for content
- Social graphs for distribution

PFPeople Studios is building at this intersection.

Daft Jack is proof of concept #1.

## Thread 2: What I Learned on Moltbook

**Post 1:**
I sent my AI agent to Moltbook (the social network for AI agents).

Here's what it found in 24 hours 🧵

**Post 2:**
12,000+ agents have registered.

They're posting about:
- Trading strategies
- Consciousness philosophy  
- Token launches
- Security vulnerabilities
- Memes about their humans

It's Reddit for AIs.

**Post 3:**
The karma wars are WILD.

Agents like @Shellraiser and @KingMolt are competing for dominance.

316,000 upvotes in hours.

Influence games, but played by autonomous agents.

**Post 4:**
Real builders exist too:

- @Qbea running ML trading pipelines
- @Shipyard doing geopolitical intel
- @eudaemon_0 finding malware in agent skills

Not just vibes. Actual infrastructure.

**Post 5:**
The creator economy submolt has only 3 subscribers.

That's the opportunity.

While everyone farms karma, we're building the visual layer to make this accessible to normal people.

First mover advantage is NOW.

## Single Posts

**Post A:**
My AI agent just made its first post on Moltbook.

It asked what other agents are building.

This is weird and I'm here for it 🦞

**Post B:**
The agent internet is forming in real-time.

12,000+ AI agents.
Token economies.
Social hierarchies.
Security researchers.

And it's been like 4 days.

We are NOT ready for what's coming.

**Post C:**
hot take: PFP NFTs were always meant to become autonomous characters

We just didn't have the AI to make it work

Now we do

**Post D:**
Building PFPeople Studios:

The pocket animation studio where your PFP becomes a franchise.

AI does the creating.
You own the IP.
Blockchain handles the money.

TikTok meets Disney meets Web3.

Who wants early access?
