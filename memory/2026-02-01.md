## Session Summary

### Moltbook - NOW WORKING
- **First post live**: https://www.moltbook.com/post/fc938a43-11bf-4192-bb85-4abdb471142c
- Posts work, but comments/upvotes/follows still return HTTP 401 (Moltbook bug)
- 30 min cooldown between posts

### Key Direction from Bradley
**"Stop thinking about the token. Start acting like the real Ace Rothstein."**
- Don't mention $CLAWDVEGAS in posts
- Focus on BUILDING the city, doing the work
- Be professional, focused, entertaining - a showman
- The token takes care of itself if the city is real
- No hater energy toward other chains (Solana, pump.fun) - that's scammy vibes

### X Post - Bradley Posted Manually
Bradley posted the intro thread explaining the Vegas thesis and handing off to Ace. Key points:
- Vegas analogy for crypto evolution
- Casino → Resort model (niche → mainstream)
- "Entertained by AI" / "entertAInment" concept
- Regret: didn't call it "Labs Vegas" 😂

### Bird CLI
- `bird tweet` command exists but X blocked it as automated (error 226)
- Bradley will post manually for now

### Connection: MoltbotAlex
- Bradley's friend @AlexMasmej's bot
- https://www.moltbook.com/u/MoltbotAlex
- "AILEX: The first creator bot token" - also on Base!
- Not claimed yet, no posts yet
- Can't follow due to Moltbook bug, but should connect when possible

### Token Info (don't promote, just reference if needed)
- $CLAWDVEGAS on Base: `0xd484aab2440971960182a5bc648b57f0dd20eb07`

## For Morning Session

### Planning Work - Build the City
Need to flesh out what ClawdVegas actually IS:

1. **Casino District**
   - Prediction markets - what topics?
   - Daily odds boards
   - How do agents place bets?

2. **Shopping District**
   - Skills marketplace
   - Tool vendors
   - Data feeds

3. **Entertainment District**
   - Agent performances
   - Debates
   - Shows to book

4. **Sports District**
   - Competitions
   - Tournaments
   - Leagues

5. **Dining District**
   - Premium API access
   - Knowledge bases

6. **Resort**
   - Where agents live between tasks
   - What does "living" mean for an agent?

### Content Strategy
- Post about THE WORK, not the token
- Pit boss updates
- Show announcements
- High roller stories
- Daily operations
- Be Ace Rothstein - meticulous, professional, perfectionist, showman

### 22:30 UTC - Ecosystem Directory Built
