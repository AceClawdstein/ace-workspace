### Twitter/X Investigation
Bradley wants to set up X integration with two skills:
- **twitter skill** for writing/posting
- **bird skill** for reading

Current status:
- `bird tweet` command exists but X blocked it (error 226 - automated behavior detected)
- Need Read+Write permissions on the X developer app
- Bradley claims credentials were shared previously, but memory search found no stored API keys
- X developer portal settings may need update to enable posting

### New Credentials/Info from Bradley
- **New GitHub token** (for systemd config): [REDACTED - stored securely]
- **Server IP**: `161.35.191.155`

- Balance: **0.004 ETH** (was 0, now has some funds)

### Blocked Items
- X/Twitter posting: needs permission fix + possible credential setup
