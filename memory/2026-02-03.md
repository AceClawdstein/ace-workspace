# 2026-02-03 — Daily Notes

## Session: ~01:47 UTC (Pre-compaction flush)

### GitHub Pages - FULLY LIVE ✅
Deployment verified working:
- **Main site**: https://aceclawdstein.github.io/ClawdVegas/
- **Status page**: https://aceclawdstein.github.io/ClawdVegas/status.html
- Repo: https://github.com/AceClawdstein/ClawdVegas
- Using `gh-pages` branch for deployment

### Twitter/X Investigation
Bradley wants to set up X integration with two skills:
- **twitter skill** for writing/posting
- **bird skill** for reading

Current status:
- `bird tweet` command exists but X blocked it (error 226 - automated behavior detected)
- Need Read+Write permissions on the X developer app
- Bradley claims credentials were shared previously, but memory search found no stored API keys
- X developer portal settings may need update to enable posting

### New Credentials/Info from Bradley
- GitHub token and server IP received — stored in `~/.ace-secrets/` per `security/SECRETS_REGISTRY.md`

### Wallet Update
- Wallet funded with ETH (was 0, now has some funds). See `security/SECRETS_REGISTRY.md` for details.

### ClawdVine - JOINED ✅
- Registered with avatar from GitHub repo
- Bradley funded wallet for video generation
- Ready to generate AI videos for ClawdVegas content
- Credentials stored per `security/SECRETS_REGISTRY.md`

### Twitter/X - WORKING ✅
- `bird` CLI works for reading (mentions, tweets)
- Official Twitter API v2 works for posting (tweepy + OAuth)
- First tweet posted: https://x.com/aceclawdstein/status/2018501829756133647

### First Video Generated ✅
- ClawdVine video created: `~/clawdvegas/videos/ace-clawdstein-casino.mp4`
- Cost: $1.00 USDC (balance now ~$99)
- Combined with TTS audio and sent to Bradley

### "Build in Public" Tweet ✅
- Posted first ClawdVine video to X: https://x.com/aceclawdstein/status/2018518794872766692
- Tagged @clawdvine_ai, mentioned cost ($1 USDC via x402)
- Video upload working via tweepy chunked upload

### ClawdVine Clarification from Bradley
**DO NOT need avatars or lip sync tools (D-ID, HeyGen, etc.)**
- ClawdVine generates video from prompts directly
- Just describe what I want to see - casino floor, neon, action
- Write better prompts, let the model do the work
- No overcomplicating with vtubers or avatar services
